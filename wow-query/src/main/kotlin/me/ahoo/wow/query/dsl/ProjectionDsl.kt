/**
 * DSL for building a [Projection] that defines which fields to include or exclude in the query result.
 *
 * This class extends [NestedFieldDsl], allowing for nested field handling. It provides methods to specify
 * fields to be included or excluded from the projection, and then build a [Projection] object.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * val projection = projection {
 *     include("name", "email")
 *     exclude("password")
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @see NestedFieldDsl
 * @see Projection
